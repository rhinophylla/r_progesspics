r/progresspics is an active subreddit where people post before and after pictures that typically document weight loss.  This repository contains Python code for processing and cleaning r/progresspics post titles to obtain information about the post author and their weight change.  It also contains additional code for conducting an exploratory data analysis into the characteristics of Redditors who post to r/progresspics and for conducting simple linear regression and multiple linear regression analyses on the extracted features.

The code is found in both Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.  To run the scripts, download the data and src files to your computer, then run the "main.py" file to extract the features and conduct the exploratory data analysis.  You can use the provided data, which contains the r/progresspics post titles from 2018, or supply your own.  To conduct the linear regression analyses, run the "main2_regression.py" file.  You can use the data you just cleaned, the provided data, or you can supply your own.  The regression functions will work on any dataset, not just those generated from r/progresspics post titles.

My analysis and results can be found in the "reports" folder.
